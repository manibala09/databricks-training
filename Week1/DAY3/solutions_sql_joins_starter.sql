-- Assignment Questions
-- 1. Display all students and the courses they are enrolled in. Include students who are not enrolled in any course.
select s.student_name, c.course_name from students s left join enrollments e on s.student_id = e.student_id left join courses c on e.course_id = c.course_id ;

-- 2. Find all courses that currently have no students enrolled.
select c.course_name from courses c left join enrollments e on c.course_id = e.course_id where e.course_id is null;

-- 3. Display all instructors and the courses they teach, including instructors who are not assigned to any course.
select i.*, c.course_name from instructors i left join courses c on c.instructor_id =  i.instructor_id ;

-- 4. Find all courses that do not have an instructor assigned.
select  c.course_name from courses c left join instructors i on c.instructor_id = i.instructor_id where i.instructor_id is null;

-- 5. Display all students and enrollment information using a RIGHT JOIN.
select * from students s right join enrollments e on s.student_id = e.student_id;

-- 6. Find students who are not enrolled in any course.
select s.student_id, s.student_name from students s left join enrollments e on s.student_id = e.student_id where e.course_id is null;

-- 7. Use a FULL OUTER JOIN to display all students and enrollments, including unmatched rows from both tables
select * from students s left outer join enrollments e on s.student_id = e.student_id union  select * from students s right outer join enrollments e on s.student_id = e.student_id ;

-- 8. Find all courses that have never appeared in the enrollments table.
select c.course_name from courses c left join enrollments e on c.course_id = e.course_id where e.course_id is null; 

-- 9. Display all instructors and courses using a FULL OUTER JOIN and identify unmatched rows.
select i.*, c.course_name from instructors i left join courses c on i.instructor_id = c.instructor_id union 
select i.*, c.course_name from instructors i right join courses c on i.instructor_id = c.instructor_id;

-- 10. Create a report showing: student name, course name, and instructor name. Include rows even if course or instructor information is missing.
select  student_name, course_name, instructor_name from students s left join enrollments e on s.student_id = e.student_id left join courses c on e.course_id = c.course_id left join instructors i on c.instructor_id = i.instructor_id;

-- Bonus Challenge:
-- Write a query that lists every student and every course, even if there is no enrollment relationship between them.
select s.student_name, c.course_name from students s cross join courses c;
